                    Uses. Bottle gardens are commonly used as a form of decoration, or as a substitute garden in areas with little space, such as patios or high rise apartments. Being easy to create and maintain, bottle gardens are also used in schools as an economical way to study miniature eco-systems within the confines of a classroom.

                <h4>A Vertical Garden</h4>
                <p>
                    The concept of a “Vertical Bottle Garden” came from the window gardens found in Europe. There are many skyscrapers that have huge window gardens in the buildings. They use specialised pumps to circulate water. The Vertical Bottle Garden in this “How To” has been modified to suit South Africans needs and accessibility to resources.

                Recycling at home is a simple yet powerful way to help protect our environment. It involves reusing materials that would otherwise be discarded, reducing the demand for new resources, and minimizing waste.

                    Wales: active policies and education  In just 20 years, the British country household recycling rate has increased from 5% to 64%, one of the highest in Europe and expects to keep improving to become one of the world’s leading nations in this field.

                    Switzerland: waste reduction  One of the countries that have best understood the importance of the circular economy is Switzerland. The Alpine country is an example of how citizen awareness can be increased through training and national policies. In this case, efforts have focused on reducing non-recyclable waste with measures such as the single bag. To get rid of this type of waste, you must buy “official” garbage bags with a higher price, while recycling is free.

                    Sweden: The Swedes separate their waste into different colored bags, depending on the type of waste, and the recycling plants separate it into recyclable and non-recyclable elements.
